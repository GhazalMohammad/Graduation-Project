‘Bloodshot’ - compared to MCU it fails miserably. BUT as its own thing. A brainless action film that’s at least worth one viewing for its sheer bold silliness - a bit like the latter career Arnie stuff with Fast &amp; Furious production values,example,2020-03-29 08:14:03+00:00
‘Doolittle’ - animation is world class. Story is overblown but easy for kids to follow. It has some hilarious moments. Perfect family film. Just Downey Jnr’s accent that’s a bit suspect (like a drunk Tom Jones?),example,2020-03-29 08:14:02+00:00

- the Kennedy stuff was the only section that didn’t really work and dragged a bit,example,2019-11-10 23:45:16+00:00
